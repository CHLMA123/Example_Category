				<pre><code>     iOS 7 and iOS 8 differ in NSURLSessionTask implementation, which makes the next bit of code a bit tricky.
     Many Unit Tests have been built to validate as much of this behavior has possible.
     Here is what we know:
        - NSURLSessionTasks are implemented with class clusters, meaning the class you request from the API isn't actually the type of class you will get back.
        - Simply referencing `[NSURLSessionTask class]` will not work. You need to ask an `NSURLSession` to actually create an object, and grab the class from there.
        - On iOS 7, `localDataTask` is a `__NSCFLocalDataTask`, which inherits from `__NSCFLocalSessionTask`, which inherits from `__NSCFURLSessionTask`.
        - On iOS 8, `localDataTask` is a `__NSCFLocalDataTask`, which inherits from `__NSCFLocalSessionTask`, which inherits from `NSURLSessionTask`.
        - On iOS 7, `__NSCFLocalSessionTask` and `__NSCFURLSessionTask` are the only two classes that have their own implementations of `resume` and `suspend`, and `__NSCFLocalSessionTask` DOES NOT CALL SUPER. This means both classes need to be swizzled.
        - On iOS 8, `NSURLSessionTask` is the only class that implements `resume` and `suspend`. This means this is the only class that needs to be swizzled.
        - Because `NSURLSessionTask` is not involved in the class hierarchy for every version of iOS, its easier to add the swizzled methods to a dummy class and manage them there.

     Some Assumptions:
        - No implementations of `resume` or `suspend` call super. If this were to change in a future version of iOS, we'd need to handle it.
        - No background task classes override `resume` or `suspend`

     The current solution:
        1) Grab an instance of `__NSCFLocalDataTask` by asking an instance of `NSURLSession` for a data task.
        2) Grab a pointer to the original implementation of `af_resume`
        3) Check to see if the current class has an implementation of resume. If so, continue to step 4.
        4) Grab the super class of the current class.
        5) Grab a pointer for the current class to the current implementation of `resume`.
        6) Grab a pointer for the super class to the current implementation of `resume`.
        7) If the current class implementation of `resume` is not equal to the super class implementation of `resume` AND the current implementation of `resume` is not equal to the original implementation of `af_resume`, THEN swizzle the methods
        8) Set the current class to the super class, and repeat steps 3-8
